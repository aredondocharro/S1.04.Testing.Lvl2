# 📄 Testing with JUnit AssertJ
## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement
Create the Java classes and/or tests that test them to demonstrate the following:

- Exercise 1
  An assertion that proves that the value of two integer objects is equal, and another that indicates that it is not.

- Exercise 2
  An assertion that proves that the reference to one object is the same as another, and another that indicates that it is different.

- Exercise 3
  An assertion that indicates that two arrays of integers are identical.

- Exercise 4
  Create an arrayList containing various types of objects (create them too). Write an assertion to verify the order of the objects in the ArrayList as they were inserted.

Now verify that the above list contains the objects in any order.
Verify that, in the above list, one of the objects has been added only once. Leave one of the elements unadded, and verify that the list does not contain the last one.
- Exercise 5
  Create a map and verify that it contains one of the keys you add to it.

- Exercise 6
  Produce an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in any class. Create an assertion that validates that the exception is thrown when appropriate.

- Exercise 7
  Create an empty Optional object. Write the correct assertion to verify that it is indeed empty.
